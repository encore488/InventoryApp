# InventoryApp
Android mobile app for warehouse and store employees conducting inventory.

This app implements a grid structure for its main page, where users can see different inventory items. It provides users with the ability to edit the name and quantity of the items and to add or delete items. Users also can create an account with username and password, then login. The app creates a database to store these things. It also sends push notifications to users when an item's quantity is reduced to 0.


The first screen a user sees is the login screen, then if they need to create an account, they can click a button to be brought to the account creation page. These are both very simple because my intended users are not techies and this is not an enertainment or education app. The main page is just a bunch of buttons that each take up one horizontal line. This works because it is my intention for the app to be more tactile and intuitive to use, with very little typing, so that users have to think as little as possible.


I approached the coding of this app by scribbling down very basic outlines to a plan, with all the key points I needed to keep in mind. Then I drew some basic page ideas so I had a goal of how to make it look. Then I just wrote code until it worked. I didn't write pseudocode because I had never made an app before, so I wasn't sure how files interacted with each other. Now, I would write pseudocode.


I used an emulator to test the code. I tested it as regularly as possible. This is important so that I don't build on top of flawed code. That would obscure where the bugs come from when debugging.
