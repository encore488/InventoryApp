# InventoryApp
Android mobile app for warehouse and store employees conducting inventory.

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This app needed to implement a grid structure for its main page, where users can see different inventory items. It needed to provide users with the ability to edit the name and quantity of the items and to add or delete items. Users also need to create an account with username and password, then login. It also needed to create a database to store these things. It should also send push notifications to users when an item's quantity is reduced to 0.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The first screen a user sees is the login screen, then if they need to create an account, they can click a button to be brought to the account creation page. These are both very simple because my intended users are not techies and this is not an enertainment or education app. The main page is just a bunch of buttons that each take up one horizontal line. This works because it is my intention for the app to be more tactile and intuitive to use, with very little typing, so that users have to think as little as possible.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approached the coding of this app by scribbling down very basic outlines to a plan, with all the key points I needed to keep in mind. Then I drew some basic page ideas so I had a goal of how to make it look. Then I just wrote code until it worked. I didn't write pseudocode because I had never made an app before, so I wasn't sure how files interacted with each other. Now, I would write pseudocode.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I used an emulator to test the code. I tested it as regularly as possible. This is important so that I don't build on top of flawed code. That would obscure where the bugs come from when debugging.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I was having difficulty finding any documentation that explained some functions I wanted to use. That's when I turned to the light. My savior, ChatGPT, explained everything to me so clearly. I was even able to avoid the snoodiness and confusion of Stack Overflow

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I feel like the SQLite database is a good demonstration of my pathetic skills. The code may not be optimized, but I give things clear names and leave enough comments. I also tend to keep things concise and avoid countless nested statements.
